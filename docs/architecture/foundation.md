# Questlog - Implementation Strategy

## Development Priority Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Objective**: Establish MVP with essential user management and basic functionality

- Project structure and tooling setup (COMPLETED)
- Database schema design and migrations
- Authentication system implementation (JWT)
- Core CRUD operations for users, games, and reviews
- Frontend application foundation with Astro/React setup

### Phase 2: Social Features (Weeks 5-8)

**Objective**: Enable user interactions and content discovery mechanisms

- User profile management and social following system
- Dynamic social feed implementation with GraphQL
- Comprehensive review system with rating capabilities
- Basic search functionality across games and users

### Phase 3: Game Integration (Weeks 9-12)

**Objective**: Rich game data integration and external API connectivity

- RAWG and IGDB API integration with caching strategies
- Comprehensive game catalog with detailed information pages
- Advanced search and filtering with Elasticsearch consideration
- File upload system for avatars and game assets

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (Weeks 13-16)

**Objective**: Scalability, monitoring, and advanced feature implementation

- Performance optimization and caching layer implementation
- Administrative panel for content moderation
- Monitoring, logging, and analytics integration
- Deployment pipeline refinement and security hardening

## Critical Technical Decisions

### Database Design Rationale

- **CUID over UUID**: Better performance and URL-friendly IDs
- **Separate genre/platform junction tables**: Enables complex filtering and analytics
- **Comprehensive indexing strategy**: Optimized for common query patterns
- **Forward compatibility**: Schema supports planned features without breaking changes

### Authentication Strategy

- **JWT with refresh tokens**: Stateless authentication with secure session management
- **Role-based access control**: Extensible permission system
- **Session tracking**: Support for multiple devices and security monitoring

### API Architecture

- **Hybrid REST/GraphQL approach**: REST for simple operations, GraphQL for complex relationships
- **Comprehensive validation**: Input validation at DTO level with class-validator
- **Standardized error handling**: Consistent error responses across all endpoints

## Next Steps After Week 1

1. **Authentication Integration**: Connect frontend auth forms to backend JWT system
2. **Game Data Integration**: Implement RAWG API client for external game data
3. **Review System Implementation**: Build the core review CRUD functionality
4. **Social Feed Development**: Create GraphQL resolvers for dynamic feed queries
5. **Frontend Component Library**: Develop reusable UI components with proper TypeScript integration

## Key Performance Considerations

- **Database Query Optimization**: Implement proper indexing and query analysis
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis integration for frequently accessed data
- **Image Optimization**: CDN setup for game covers and user avatars
- **API Rate Limiting**: Protect against abuse and ensure fair usage
- **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting and lazy loading for frontend performance

This structured approach ensures a solid foundation while maintaining flexibility for future feature expansion and scalability requirements.
